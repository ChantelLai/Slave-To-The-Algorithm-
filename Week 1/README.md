# Week 1.
For week 1 of Slave To The Algorithm we began by growing an undestanding of what Parametric and Generative Design is, looking at a variety of designers creating a variety of different styles of works from moving visuals to 3D architectural structures. In order to strengthen this understanding we compared it to our every day life and parametric systems such as making breakfast where there lies multiple sets of variables that we go through in order to reach the final result. We then participated in an activity called parametric drawing where we would create several different variables and 6 different possibilites for each that were then selected by the roll of a dice. Going through this excersize really solidified what the procedure of parametric design is. Finally we began our work on this, our new GiHub accounts. 
## Week 1 Research. 
*Here are some of designers we learnt about during our introduction to parametric/generative design that happened to catch my eye.*<br/>

Here I created 4 different characteristics colour, shape, canvas shape and line type with 6 variations within each (apologies for the orange and yellow being quite faint).
